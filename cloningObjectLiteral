Cloning an Existing Object

The Object.create function can also be used to clone an existing object as follows:

1 var rectangle = {
2     area: function () {
3         return this.width * this.height;
4     }
5 };
6 
7 var rect = Object.create(rectangle);
In the above example rect inherits the area function from rectangle. Also notice that rectangle is an object literal. An object literal is a succinct way of creating a clone of Object.prototype and extending it with new properties. It's equivalent to:

1 var rectangle = Object.create(Object.prototype);
2 
3 rectangle.area = function () {
4     return this.width * this.height;
5 };
